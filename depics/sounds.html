					So this package is something that will, hopefully, make your iDevices less annoying to use by removing some of the unnecessary sounds that they make. This is a theme that is used with <strong>Winterboard</strong>, as it functions almost like a tweak. 
					<br><br>
					This theme consists of four packages. 
					<br><br>
					• <strong>NoPowerSound</strong> - This will remove the sound/vibration that always sounds whenever your phone is plugged in. This also removes the "respring chirp" that occurs. This effectively make the tweaks <strong>PowerSoundDisabler</strong> and <strong>NoRespringChirp</strong> redundant. 
					<br><br>
					• <strong>NoKeypressSounds</strong> - This removes the sounds that play when you are dialing numbers in the phone app. 
					<br><br>
					• <strong>NoShutterSound</strong> - This removes the shutter sound when you are taking pictures with the camera app. <i>This does not remove burst mode shutter sounds yet, but will do so in future updates.</i>
					<br><br>
					• <strong>NoFaceTimeSounds</strong> - Removes - you got it - those FaceTime ringing sounds that you can never mute because the volume will never go below 6% due to the iOS lower threshold volume limit. Except with this, of course. 
					<br><br>
					<strong>NOTE:</strong> These are simply themes that require Winterboard to run. As Winterboard is a substrate tweak, these will <i>not</i> work in Safe Mode or Non-Substrate Mode. This is because the themes do not overwrite the original files, but merely use the help of Winterboard to replace them while your device is in substrate mode with Winterboard's dynamic library enabled. So, for example, if you enable "NoPowerSound," your power sound/vibration will be muted/prevented. However, if you crash to Safe Mode for any reason and plug your phone in (or if it's already plugged in :P), it will sound the power sound (or vibrate if it's on silent).
